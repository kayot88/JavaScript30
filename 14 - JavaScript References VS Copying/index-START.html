      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let age = 100;
      // let age2 = age;
      // console.log(age, age2);
      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'ðŸ’©'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // console.log(team);
      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      // console.log(team4);
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
        social: {
          fb: 'gromov',
          tw: 'goodboy'
        }
      };
      // and think we make a copy:
      const dev = person;
      // dev.name = 'Gromov';
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const dev2 = Object.assign({}, person);
      // dev2.name = 'gromov';

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const dev3 = { ...person };
      dev3.age = 150;
      // dev3.social.tw = '4len';
      console.clear();
      // console.log(person);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const dev4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
      dev4.social.tw = 'rrr';
      console.log(dev4);
